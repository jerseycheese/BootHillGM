# BootHillGM Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies (MVP Focus)

## 1. Learning Curve and Technology Adoption

### Risk:
Challenges in learning and effectively implementing React, Next.js, and associated technologies within the project timeline.

### Mitigation:
- Allocate dedicated time for learning and experimentation at the start of the project.
- Focus on core React and Next.js concepts essential for MVP development.
- Utilize official documentation, tutorials, and community resources.
- Start with simpler implementations and iteratively improve as skills develop.

## 2. AI Integration Complexity

### Risk:
Difficulties in achieving coherent and context-aware responses from the Gemini API for the Western setting and Boot Hill RPG rules.

### Mitigation:
- Begin with basic prompt engineering and gradually refine based on results.
- Implement fallback mechanisms for handling unexpected AI responses.
- Maintain a log of successful prompts and interactions for reference.
- Consider implementing a simple rules-based system as a backup for critical game mechanics.

## 3. Scope Creep

### Risk:
Tendency to add features beyond MVP requirements, potentially delaying completion.

### Mitigation:
- Clearly define and document MVP features at the project's outset.
- Regularly review and reaffirm MVP goals throughout development.
- Maintain a separate list of post-MVP features for future consideration.
- Focus on core gameplay functionality before adding non-essential features.

## 4. Performance Issues

### Risk:
Slow loading times or poor responsiveness, particularly during AI interactions or with larger game states.

### Mitigation:
- Utilize Next.js built-in performance optimizations.
- Implement basic caching for frequently accessed data.
- Optimize AI interactions by minimizing unnecessary API calls.
- Regularly test performance on various devices and network conditions.

## 5. Data Management and Persistence

### Risk:
Challenges in effectively managing and persisting complex game states.

### Mitigation:
- Start with a simplified game state model for the MVP.
- Utilize localStorage for basic data persistence in the MVP phase.
- Implement robust error handling for data saving and loading operations.
- Regularly test save/load functionality throughout development.

## 6. User Experience Consistency

### Risk:
Inconsistent or poor user experience across different devices and browsers.

### Mitigation:
- Focus on a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Utilize CSS Modules for consistent styling across components.
- Implement progressive enhancement techniques for broader browser support.
- Conduct regular testing on various devices and browsers throughout development.

## 7. AI Cost Management

### Risk:
Unexpected or high costs associated with frequent AI API usage.

### Mitigation:
- Implement usage tracking and alerts to monitor API consumption.
- Optimize prompts and responses to minimize token usage.
- Consider implementing caching for common AI responses.
- Set up cost thresholds and alerts to prevent unexpected expenses.

## 8. Time Management

### Risk:
Difficulty in balancing learning, development, and personal commitments, potentially leading to missed deadlines.

### Mitigation:
- Create a realistic development schedule that accounts for learning time.
- Break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.
- Use project management tools to track progress and deadlines.
- Regularly reassess and adjust the project timeline as needed.

## 9. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Risk:
Inadequate testing leading to bugs or poor user experience in the MVP.

### Mitigation:
- Implement basic unit tests for critical functions from the start.
- Conduct regular manual testing of core gameplay loops.
- Engage friends or family for user testing and feedback.
- Maintain a log of known issues and prioritize fixes based on impact.

## 10. Deployment and Production Readiness

### Risk:
Challenges in deploying and maintaining the application in a production environment.

### Mitigation:
- Familiarize yourself with Next.js deployment options early in the development process.
- Set up a staging environment for pre-production testing.
- Document the deployment process and any environment-specific configurations.
- Implement basic error logging and monitoring for the production environment.

This risk assessment focuses on the most relevant challenges for MVP development by a single developer new to React and Next.js, with considerations for personal/family/friends usage. Regularly review and update this assessment as the project progresses.
