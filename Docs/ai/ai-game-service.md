# AI Game Service Architecture

## Overview
The AI Game Service is a core component of BootHillGM, responsible for:
- Processing player inputs and game context
- Generating narrative responses with the AI model
- Handling game state updates based on AI responses
- Providing fallback mechanisms for error scenarios

This document describes the modular architecture of the AI Game Service following its recent refactoring.

## Component Structure

The AI Game Service has been refactored from a monolithic service into a modular architecture of specialized components:

```
/app/services/ai/
├── gameService.ts                  # Main orchestrator (entry point)
├── types/
│   └── gameService.types.ts        # Type definitions
├── fallback/
│   └── fallbackService.ts          # Fallback response generation
├── utils/
│   ├── promptBuilder.ts            # AI prompt construction
│   ├── responseValidator.ts        # Validate AI responses
│   └── responseHelper.ts           # Helper functions for response processing
```

### Core Components

#### 1. gameService.ts
**Purpose**: Orchestrates the AI response process
- Handles both object-based and parameter-based function calls
- Coordinates the request/response flow
- Implements error handling and timeout management
- Dispatches to appropriate utility functions

```typescript
// Function supports both calling styles
export async function getAIResponse(
  promptOrParams: string | AIResponseParams,
  journalContext?: string,
  inventory?: InventoryItem[],
  storyProgressionContext?: string,
  narrativeContext?: NarrativeContext,
  loreStore?: LoreStore
): Promise<GameServiceResponse> {
  // Implementation details...
}
```

#### 2. gameService.types.ts
**Purpose**: Centralizes type definitions for the game service system
- Defines data structures for AI responses and parameters
- Provides type safety for service interactions
- Ensures consistent data shape across components

Key types include:
- `GameServiceResponse`: The structured data returned by the AI
- `AIResponseParams`: Parameters for making AI requests
- `FallbackResponse`: Structure for fallback responses
- `LoreExtractionResult`: Format for extracted lore data

#### 3. fallbackService.ts
**Purpose**: Generates context-appropriate fallback responses
- Provides responses when the AI service is unavailable
- Categorizes responses based on action type
- Creates reasonable suggestions for player actions
- Maintains a consistent tone and style

#### 4. promptBuilder.ts
**Purpose**: Constructs appropriate prompts for the AI model
- Builds comprehensive context for the AI
- Formats inventory, narrative context, and player decisions
- Includes appropriate instruction templates
- Maintains a consistent style for AI responses

#### 5. responseValidator.ts
**Purpose**: Validates and processes AI responses
- Ensures response structure meets expectations
- Handles edge cases and invalid data
- Applies default values when needed
- Formats data for consistent consumption

#### 6. responseHelper.ts
**Purpose**: Provides utility functions for AI response handling
- Implements timeout mechanisms with Promise racing
- Cleans and formats response text
- Facilitates error handling and recovery

## API Interface

The Game Service supports two calling styles for backward compatibility:

### 1. Object Parameter Style (Recommended)
```typescript
await getAIResponse({
  prompt: "Player input here",
  journalContext: "Recent game events...",
  inventory: playerInventory,
  storyProgressionContext: undefined,
  narrativeContext: currentNarrativeContext
});
```

### 2. Positional Parameter Style (Legacy)
```typescript
await getAIResponse(
  "Player input here",
  "Recent game events...",
  playerInventory,
  undefined,
  currentNarrativeContext
);
```

## Error Handling

The service implements robust error handling:
- Timeouts for unresponsive AI requests
- Parsing errors for invalid JSON
- API failures and network errors
- Invalid response structures

All errors result in appropriate fallback responses based on the context.

## Integration Points

### Integration with useAIWithOptimizedContext

The `useAIWithOptimizedContext` hook provides a streamlined API for making AI requests with narrative context:

```typescript
const { makeAIRequest } = useAIWithOptimizedContext();

// Later in component code:
const response = await makeAIRequest(playerInput, playerInventory);
```

This hook handles:
- Context optimization
- Opponent normalization
- Performance metrics
- Comprehensive error handling

## Performance Considerations

The refactored service implements several performance optimizations:
- Configurable timeout (currently 15s) with automatic fallback
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Efficient prompt construction to minimize token usage
- Clean response parsing with minimal overhead

## Testing

The AI Game Service is fully covered by unit and integration tests:
- Tests for both calling styles (object and positional parameters)
- Error and timeout scenario testing
- Validation of response processing
- Fallback response generation testing
