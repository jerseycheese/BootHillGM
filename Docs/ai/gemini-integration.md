# Gemini Integration

This document describes the integration of the Gemini API into the Boot Hill GM application.

## AI Model Integration

### Prompt Engineering

- Design a set of base prompts for common game scenarios (e.g., dialogue, exploration, combat)
- Include simplified Boot Hill RPG rules and Western setting details in prompts
- Implement a basic system to construct prompts based on current game state

### Context Management

- Maintain a limited context of recent game events and player actions
- Implement a simple summarization mechanism to keep context within token limits

## Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

### Input Interpretation

- Implement basic keyword matching for player inputs
- Provide clarification prompts for ambiguous inputs

### Output Validation

- Implement basic checks for AI-generated content relevance
- Use predefined fallback responses for unsuitable AI outputs

### Connection Issues

- Implement basic error messages for API timeouts or failures

## Web Application Considerations

### API Integration

- Use Next.js API routes for fundamental AI interactions
- Implement basic error handling for API calls

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time Optimization

- Implement basic caching for frequently used game data
- Optimize prompt construction to minimize token usage
