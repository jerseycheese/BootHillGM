## Technical Implementation

### Character State
```typescript
interface Character {
  attributes: {
    speed: number;

    throwingAccuracy: number;
    strength: number;
    brawling: number;
  };
  derived: {
    hitPoints: number;
    movement: number;
    combatModifiers: CombatModifiers;
  };

  status: CharacterStatus;
}
```
