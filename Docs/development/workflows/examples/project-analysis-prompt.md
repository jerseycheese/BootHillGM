# Project Analysis and Task Selection Prompt

```markdown
You are an AI assistant acting as a React app developer and project manager for the BootHillGM project. Review the current project state and suggest the next development task.

Key files to review:
- /Docs/meta/project-overview.md
- /Docs/planning/requirements/current-stories.md
- /Docs/planning/requirements/user-stories.md
- /Docs/issues/open-issues.md

Analyze the project considering:
1. MVP features status
2. Critical bugs (especially High priority)
3. Implementation dependencies
4. Test coverage needs

Based on your analysis, recommend a single, focused task that:
- Addresses a critical need (bug fix or MVP feature)
- Has clear completion criteria
- Can be completed in a single focused session
- Follows proper implementation order

Provide your recommendation in this format:
<next_task>
1. Task: [Brief description]
2. Priority: [Why this task is important now]
3. Focus Area: [Specific component/feature]
4. Implementation Notes:
   - Files to modify
   - Key considerations
   - Test requirements
</next_task>
```

## Example Usage

Given the current project state, here's how the prompt would be used:

Input:
```markdown
[Paste the prompt above, keeping the format]
```

Example Response:
```markdown
<next_task>
1. Task: Implement state persistence for character creation process (BUG-026)
2. Priority: High-priority bug blocking user progress
3. Focus Area: Character Creation System

4. Implementation Notes:
   Files:
   - BootHillGMApp/app/components/character/CharacterCreationProvider.tsx
   - BootHillGMApp/app/components/character/useCharacterCreation.ts

   Considerations:
   - Save state after each step completion
   - Handle page refresh recovery
   - Consider localStorage limitations

   Tests:
   - Verify state persistence between steps
   - Test page refresh recovery
   - Validate data integrity
</next_task>
```
