# Claude Session Log - 2025-01-01

## Session Focus
- Implementing Boot Hill v2 damage calculation system
- Integration with combat resolution flow

## Key Decisions
1. Damage Calculation:
   - Pure function approach for calculations
   - Separate logic for criticals and modifiers
   - Type-safe interfaces for damage results

2. Integration Points:
   - Combat system for resolution
   - Character sheet for applying damage
   - Combat log for result display

## Implementation Progress
### Completed Components
- Core damage calculation system
- Critical hit implementation
- Hit location effects
- Unit test coverage

### Technical Solutions
```typescript
interface DamageResult {
  base: number;
  critical?: boolean;
  locationMultiplier: number;
  final: number;
  effects: string[];
}
```

## Action Items
- [ ] Add integration tests with CombatSystem
- [ ] Update damage display component
- [ ] Document new damage calculation rules
- [ ] Review edge cases in testing

## Knowledge Base Updates
- New damage calculation patterns
- Critical hit implementation details
- Location effect system design

## Notes for Next Session
- Consider status effect integration
- Plan armor system implementation
- Review performance implications

## Technical Considerations
1. State Management:
   - Damage calculation results
   - Combat log updates
   - Character state changes

2. Error Handling:
   - Invalid weapon configurations
   - Missing hit locations
   - Edge case validation
