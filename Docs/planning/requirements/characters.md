# Character System Requirements

This document outlines the technical requirements and specifications for the BootHillGM character system implementation.

## Core Requirements

### Character Creation
1. Attribute Generation
   - Base attribute calculation
   - Modifier application
   - Skill allocation
   - Background generation

2. Character Management
   - State persistence
   - Inventory tracking
   - Skill progression
   - Relationship tracking

3. Character Integration
   - Combat integration
   - Narrative integration
   - AI interaction
   - State management

## Technical Specifications

### Character State
```typescript
interface CharacterState {
  attributes: CharacterAttributes;
  skills: CharacterSkills;
  inventory: InventoryState;
  status: CharacterStatus;
  relationships: CharacterRelationships;
  history: CharacterEvent[];
}
```

### Character Components
```typescript
interface CharacterAttributes {
  speed: number;
  gunAccuracy: number;
  throwingAccuracy: number;
  strength: number;
  brawling: number;
  modifiers: AttributeModifier[];
}
```
