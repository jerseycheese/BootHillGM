# Current Development Priorities

## Active Sprint Focus
Currently in Phase 3: Game Mechanics Implementation, with focus on completing essential gameplay systems.

## High Priority Tasks

### Combat System Enhancements
- [x] Basic combat system implementation
- [x] Turn-based combat flow
- [x] Health tracking
- [x] Combat log
- [x] Weapon combat framework
- [x] Critical hits/misses
- [x] Combat-inventory integration
- [x] Combat hook refactoring

### Status Display (In Progress)
- [ ] Health display format enhancement
      Priority: High
      Dependencies: None
      Notes: Needs to integrate with combat system updates

- [ ] State persistence improvements
      Priority: High
      Dependencies: Status display format
      Notes: Ensure consistent state across navigation

### Boot Hill Integration (Pending)
- [ ] Rulebook reference tables
      Priority: High
      Dependencies: None
      Notes: Required for accurate game mechanics

- [ ] Dice rolling system implementation
      Priority: High
      Dependencies: None
      Notes: Core gameplay mechanic

### Inventory System Refinements
- [x] Basic inventory structure
- [x] Display component
- [x] Add/remove functionality
- [ ] Item usage restrictions
      Priority: High
      Dependencies: None
      Notes: Prevent invalid item usage, add feedback

## Success Metrics for Current Sprint
1. Complete status display improvements
2. Implement Boot Hill core mechanics
3. Finish inventory system logical checks

## Technical Debt Items
1. Error handling implementation
2. Loading indicators for AI responses
3. Performance optimization for combat system
4. Test coverage expansion

## Next Up
1. Phase 4: Polish and Testing
   - UI/UX improvements
   - Performance optimization
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Error handling

## Notes for Implementation
- Focus on completing core gameplay mechanics before moving to polish phase
- Prioritize user feedback and error handling
- Maintain balance between feature development and code quality

## Claude's Development Notes
- Monitor state management across components
- Ensure consistent error handling
- Track performance implications of new features
- Maintain documentation alongside development
