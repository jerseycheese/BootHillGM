# Claude Session Log - 2024-12-28

## Session Focus

- Implementing core dice rolling system
- Creating RuleTable type definitions
- Updating documentation
- Creating user stories for next steps

## Key Decisions

-   Implemented a new `rollDice` function instead of modifying the existing one in `brawlingSystem.ts` to support modifiers, advantage, and disadvantage.
-   Created `diceUtils.ts` to house the new dice rolling utility function.
-   Created `ruleTableTypes.ts` to define the structure of rule tables using TypeScript interfaces.
-   Used `current-stories.md` to document user stories for upcoming development tasks.
-   Updated `roadmap.md`, `workflow.md`, `component-structure.md`, and `combat-system.md` to reflect the work completed in this session.

## Implementation Progress

-   Created `diceUtils.ts` and implemented the `rollDice` function with support for various dice rolling options.
-   Wrote comprehensive tests for `rollDice` in `diceUtils.test.ts`, covering different scenarios and edge cases.
-   Created `ruleTableTypes.ts` with initial type definitions for `RuleTable`, `TableEntry`, and `TableModifier`.
-   Updated the following documentation files:
    -   `Docs/planning/roadmap.md`: Updated progress and critical path items.
    -   `Docs/technical-guides/workflow.md`: Added a section on creating and testing utility functions.
    -   `Docs/architecture/component-structure.md`: Briefly described the `diceUtils.ts` utility.
    -   `Docs/core-systems/combat-system.md`: Detailed the integration of `rollDice` and the plan for incorporating rule tables.
    -   `Docs/planning/requirements/current-stories.md`: Added user stories for the next development steps.

## Action Items

-   [ ] Integrate `rollDice` into `CombatSystem.tsx`.
-   [ ] Gather information and refine `RuleTable` definitions.
-   [ ] Create test cases for the rule table system.

## Knowledge Base Updates

-   New utility function: `diceUtils.ts`
-   New type definitions: `ruleTableTypes.ts`
-   Updated documentation:
    -   `Docs/planning/roadmap.md`
    -   `Docs/technical-guides/workflow.md`
    -   `Docs/architecture/component-structure.md`
    -   `Docs/core-systems/combat-system.md`
    -   `Docs/planning/requirements/current-stories.md`

## Notes for Next Session

-   Begin working on integrating `rollDice` into `CombatSystem.tsx`.
-   Start researching Boot Hill rule tables to gather information for refining the `RuleTable` type definitions.
