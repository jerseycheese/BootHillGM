# AI Game Master Integration

## Overview
The AI Game Master (GM) is the core component of BootHillGM, responsible for creating and managing the game world.

## Purpose
The AI Integration documentation aims to:
- Provide technical implementation details for developers
- Document AI integration patterns and architecture
- Serve as a reference for AI-related components
- Maintain consistency across system integrations

# AI Game Master Integration

## Overview
The AI Game Master (GM) is the core component of BootHillGM, responsible for creating and managing the game world, narrating the story, and facilitating player interactions within a simplified Boot Hill RPG framework.

For technical implementation details, see [[../ai/gemini-integration|Gemini API Integration]].

## Core Functions

### Narrative Generation
- [x] Generate descriptive text for locations, characters, and events
- [x] Adapt narrative based on player choices
- [x] Theme analysis system for contextual storytelling
- [x] Automatic theme detection from player actions
- [x] Enhanced prompts incorporating Western themes
- [ ] Create linear main storyline with minimal branching

For prompt details, see [[../ai/prompt-engineering/storytelling|Storytelling Prompts]].

### Character Interaction
- [x] Generate NPC dialogues based on personality types
- [x] Process player inputs using pattern matching
- [ ] Maintain NPC behavior consistency in sessions

For character creation details, see [[../features/_completed/character-creation|Character Creation]].

### Game Mechanics Integration
- [x] Interpret and apply Boot Hill RPG rules
- [x] Manage skill checks and combat resolution
- [x] Track game state (character stats, inventory, quests)

For combat-specific details, see [[../core-systems/combat-system|Combat System]].

### World Management
- [ ] Maintain small-scale world state (town and surroundings)
- [ ] Manage time progression (day/night cycle)

### Journal Integration
- [x] Generate narrative summaries for player actions
- [x] Create concise 1-2 sentence summaries
- [x] Include contextual details
- [x] Use proper character references

For journal details, see [[../core-systems/journal-system|Journal System]].

## Technical Implementation

### Context Management
- [x] Maintain recent game events and actions context
- [x] Implement summarization for token limit management
- [ ] Clear non-essential context data regularly

For context guidelines, see [[../ai/prompt-engineering/core-prompts|Core Prompts]].

### Error Handling
- [x] Process player input with keyword matching
- [x] Provide clarification for ambiguous inputs
- [x] Validate AI-generated content
- [x] Use fallback responses when needed
- [x] Handle API timeouts and failures

### Performance Optimization
- [x] Cache frequently used game data
- [x] Optimize prompt construction
- [x] Efficient state storage implementation

## Integration Points

### State Management
- [x] React Context integration for game state
- [x] State updates for game progress
- [x] Next.js API routes for AI communication

For state management details, see [[../core-systems/state-management|State Management]].

### User Interface
- [x] Text-based response rendering
- [x] Formatted output for game data
- [x] Basic caching implementation

For UI details, see [[../architecture/ui-wireframes|UI Wireframes]].
