# Combat System

## Overview
The BootHillGM combat system implements turn-based combat following Boot Hill RPG rules, with support for both brawling and weapon-based combat. The system is built around a core combat engine with dedicated UI components and state management.
For rules reference, see [[../boot-hill-rules/combat-rules|Boot Hill Combat Rules]].

## Core Components

### Combat Engine
- Uses `useCombatEngine` hook for core logic
- Manages turn-based combat flow
- Handles damage calculation
- Maintains combat log
- Supports state restoration

For implementation details, see [[../architecture/state-management|State Management]].

### Brawling Engine
The brawling system implements a realistic two-round combat flow using a modular hook-based architecture that separates concerns between state management, actions, and synchronization:

- **State Management (useBrawlingState)**: Handles combat state with proper type safety
- **Actions (useBrawlingActions)**: Processes combat actions and manages flow
- **Synchronization (useBrawlingSync)**: Aligns local combat state with global game state
- **Orchestration (useBrawlingCombat)**: Combines the above hooks into a unified API

The system follows an authentic Boot Hill implementation with:
- Two-round combat turns
- Punch and grapple options with different damage tables
- Location-based damage (head, torso, arms, legs)
- Wound tracking and strength reduction
- Modifiers based on previous actions

For brawling rules, see [[../boot-hill-rules/base-numbers|Base Numbers Calculation]].

### Combat UI Components
- **CombatStatus**: Health display for combatants
- **CombatControls**: Turn and action management
- **CombatLog**: Scrollable combat history

## Technical Implementation

### Combat State
```typescript
interface CombatState {
  currentTurn: 'player' | 'opponent';
  combatLog: string[];
  participants: {
    playerCharacterId: string;
    opponentCharacterId: string;
  },
  weapon?: {
    round: number;
    playerWeapon: Weapon | null;
    opponentWeapon: Weapon | null;
    currentRange: number;
    roundLog: LogEntry[];
    lastAction?: WeaponCombatAction['type'];
  };
}
```
The CombatState interface defines the structure for managing real-time combat data. It tracks the current turn, maintains a combat log, and holds weapon-specific state if weapon combat is active. Importantly, it now uses `playerCharacterId` and `opponentCharacterId` to reference `Character` objects for participants, instead of storing duplicated strength values.

### Brawling State
```typescript
interface BrawlingState {
  round: 1 | 2;
  playerModifier: number;
  opponentModifier: number;
  playerCharacterId: string;
  opponentCharacterId: string;
  roundLog: LogEntry[];
}
```

The BrawlingState maintains just the essential data needed for brawling combat:
- Round counter (limited to 1 or 2 per Boot Hill rules)
- Combat modifiers for both participants
- Character IDs for data references
- Combat log entries

Note that strength values are no longer stored in the BrawlingState, as they are now managed through the Character system.

### Character-Combat Integration

The brawling system now fully integrates with the character system for strength management:

1. Strength values are stored in Character objects, not in combat state
2. Wounds are applied directly to Characters and affect their strength
3. The combat system references characters by ID rather than duplicating data
4. Damage calculations use current character strength from attributes

This approach ensures:
- Single source of truth for character data
- Proper persistence of combat effects
- Accurate strength calculations that account for all wound sources
- Consistent character state across the application

### Combat Log Entries
```typescript
interface LogEntry {
  text: string;
  type: 'hit' | 'miss' | 'critical' | 'info';
  timestamp: number;
}
```

The combat logging system tracks all combat actions with timestamped entries for game history and UI display.

### Wound System
```typescript
interface Wound {
  location: 'head' | 'chest' | 'abdomen' | 'leftArm' | 'rightArm' | 'leftLeg' | 'rightLeg';
  severity: 'light' | 'serious' | 'mortal';
  strengthReduction: number;
  turnReceived: number;
  damage: number;
}
```

### Strength Validation System
The strength system ensures combat participants' strength is correctly derived from Character attributes and accounts for wound effects. Strength values are no longer directly managed in the combat state.

#### Key Features
- Derives strength values from Character attributes during combat calculations
- Handles wound stacking and timing via Character wounds
- Uses `calculateCurrentStrength` function to determine effective strength
- Ensures a minimum strength threshold (1)

#### Wound Effects
```typescript
const WOUND_EFFECTS = {
  LIGHT: 3,
  SERIOUS: 7,
  MORTAL: Infinity
};
```

#### Strength Calculation
```typescript
function calculateCurrentStrength(character: Character): number {
  const totalReduction = character.wounds.reduce(
    (total, wound) => total + wound.strengthReduction,
    0
  );
  return Math.max(1, character.attributes.baseStrength - totalReduction);
}
```

#### Integration Points
- Combat state initialization
- Damage application
- Wound processing
- Defeat condition checks

### Combat Results
```typescript
interface WeaponCombatResult {
  type: 'fire' | 'aim' | 'move' | 'reload' | 'malfunction';
  hit: boolean;
  roll: number;
  modifiedRoll: number;
  targetNumber: number;
  message: string;
  damage?: number;
  newStrength?: number;
  targetRange?: number;
  weaponMalfunction?: boolean;
}
```

### Brawling Results
```typescript
interface BrawlingResult {
  roll: number;
  result: string;
  damage: number;
  location: "head" | "chest" | "abdomen" | "leftArm" | "rightArm" | "leftLeg" | "rightLeg";
  nextRoundModifier: number;
}
```

The BrawlingResult provides detailed information about each combat action, including the roll value, hit description, damage inflicted, hit location, and modifiers for subsequent rounds.

## Combat Flow

### Brawling Combat Flow
1. **Initialization**:
   - Combat state setup with player and opponent character IDs
   - Initial modifiers set to 0
   - Round counter set to 1

2. **Combat Round**:
   - Player selects action (punch or grapple)
   - System resolves player action with appropriate modifiers
   - Damage is applied to opponent character if hit is successful
   - System resolves opponent action (AI-controlled)
   - Damage is applied to player character if hit is successful
   - Round completion is logged
   - Round counter advances (1 â†’ 2)
   - Modifiers are updated based on action results

3. **Knockout Check**:
   - After each action, system checks for knockout conditions
   - If either participant's strength is reduced to 0, combat ends
   - Winner is determined and combat summary is generated

4. **Combat Resolution**:
   - Final state is synchronized to global game state
   - Combat results are logged to journal
   - UI is updated to reflect combat outcome

### Weapon Combat Initialization
1. Combat state setup
2. Weapon assignment (if applicable)
3. Initial range determination
4. Turn order establishment

### Turn Structure
1. Action selection
2. Action resolution
3. State updates, including participant tracking using Character references
4. Combat log entry creation
5. Victory/defeat check

### State Management
- Atomic state updates
- Combat state persistence
- State restoration on page reload
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Integration Points

For weapon details, see [[../boot-hill-rules/weapons-chart|Weapons Reference]].

### Brawling Combat Actions
The brawling system implements two primary action types:

#### Punching
- Higher potential damage
- Targets primarily head and upper body
- Uses the PUNCHING_TABLE for hit resolution:
  ```typescript
  export const PUNCHING_TABLE: BrawlingTable = {
    2: { result: 'Miss', damage: 0, location: 'head', nextRoundModifier: -2 },
    3: { result: 'Glancing Blow', damage: 1, location: 'leftArm', nextRoundModifier: -1 },
    4: { result: 'Solid Hit', damage: 2, location: 'chest', nextRoundModifier: 0 },
    5: { result: 'Strong Hit', damage: 3, location: 'head', nextRoundModifier: 1 },
    6: { result: 'Critical Hit', damage: 4, location: 'head', nextRoundModifier: 2 }
  };
  ```

#### Grappling
- More consistent damage
- Wider range of target locations
- Uses the GRAPPLING_TABLE for hit resolution:
  ```typescript
  export const GRAPPLING_TABLE: BrawlingTable = {
    2: { result: 'Miss', damage: 0, location: 'chest', nextRoundModifier: -2 },
    3: { result: 'Weak Hold', damage: 1, location: 'leftArm', nextRoundModifier: -1 },
    4: { result: 'Firm Grip', damage: 2, location: 'chest', nextRoundModifier: 0 },
    5: { result: 'Strong Lock', damage: 3, location: 'leftLeg', nextRoundModifier: 1 },
    6: { result: 'Submission Hold', damage: 4, location: 'head', nextRoundModifier: 2 }
  };
  ```

## Performance Considerations

### State Updates
- Debounced combat state persistence
- Memoized component renders
- Optimized combat log management

### Error Handling

#### State Validation
The combat system includes comprehensive state validation to ensure data integrity. The validation system:

- Validates required properties (combatType, participants, rounds, combatLog)
- Ensures proper data types and value ranges
- Cleans up unnecessary properties
- Provides detailed error reporting

Validation occurs during:
- Combat state initialization
- Combat state updates
- Combat state restoration
- Combat end transitions

#### Action Validation
- Verifies valid action types
- Ensures proper action parameters
- Validates action preconditions

#### State Recovery
- State restoration fallbacks
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Graceful degradation

For implementation details, see [[../architecture/state-management|State Management]] and [[../architecture/technical-specification|Technical Specification]].

## Dice Rolling and Rule Tables

The combat system utilizes the `rollDice` function from `diceUtils.ts` to handle all dice rolls during combat. This function provides a centralized and comprehensive way to manage dice rolls, supporting various options like the number of dice, sides, modifiers, advantage, and disadvantage.

### Brawling Combat Integration
The `rollDice` function has been fully integrated into the brawling combat system, replacing the previous local implementation. This change:
- Centralizes dice rolling logic across all combat systems
- Improves code reuse and maintainability
- Supports consistent dice rolling behavior
- Enables future enhancements like advantage/disadvantage in brawling

**Integration of `rollDice`:**

- The `rollDice` function is called whenever a dice roll is needed within the combat system, including:
  - Brawling attack rolls
  - Weapon attack rolls
  - Damage calculations
  - Skill checks
- The function's parameters are determined based on the specific combat situation, taking into account factors like weapon type, character stats, and situational modifiers.
- The results of the dice rolls are then used to determine the outcome of combat actions, such as whether an attack hits, how much damage is dealt, and whether any special effects are triggered.

**Testing and Validation:**
The integration of `rollDice` into the brawling combat system has been thoroughly tested, with all unit tests passing successfully. This ensures the system maintains its existing behavior while benefiting from the centralized dice rolling logic.

**Next Steps for Rule Tables:**

- The current combat system does not yet fully incorporate all Boot Hill rule tables.
- The next step is to integrate these tables using the type definitions provided in `ruleTableTypes.ts`.
- This will involve:
  1. **Gathering Information:** Researching and documenting the specific rule tables needed for the game, such as hit location tables, damage modifier tables, range modifier tables, and skill check difficulty tables.
  2. **Refining Type Definitions:** Expanding and refining the `RuleTable`, `TableEntry`, and `TableModifier` types in `ruleTableTypes.ts` to accurately represent the structure and data of these tables.
  3. **Implementing Table Integration:** Modifying the combat system to look up and apply data from the rule tables during combat calculations. This will likely involve creating functions that take the current combat state as input and return the appropriate table entries or modifiers based on the situation.
  4. **Testing:** Thoroughly testing the integration of rule tables to ensure they are being applied correctly and produce the expected results in various combat scenarios.

By completing these steps, the combat system will become more accurate and aligned with the Boot Hill rule set, providing a more authentic and engaging gameplay experience.
