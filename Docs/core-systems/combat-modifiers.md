# Combat Modifiers Enhancement

## Overview
Implementation of enhanced combat mechanics with weapon modifiers to provide more detailed and accurate combat simulation based on Boot Hill v2 rules.

## Purpose
This documentation serves as a technical reference for developers working on combat mechanics, providing insights into the architecture, implementation details, and best practices. It's particularly relevant for:
- Game mechanics developers implementing combat features
- Technical reviewers assessing combat system architecture
- QA engineers testing combat mechanics

## Implementation Details

### Features

#### Weapon Modifiers
- Range-based accuracy modifiers
- Weapon-specific damage calculations
- Ammunition type effects
- Weapon reliability factors

#### Environmental Modifiers
- Cover and concealment effects
- Weather impact on accuracy
- Terrain modifiers
- Lighting conditions

#### Character Status Modifiers
- Injury effects on combat
- Fatigue impact
- Position-based modifiers
- Special ability interactions

### Integration Points
- Combat system core
- State management updates
- UI modifications

### Technical Requirements
- State management extensions
- Combat calculator updates
- UI component modifications
- Testing framework updates

### Development Priorities
1. Core modifier system implementation
2. UI updates for modifier display
3. State management integration
4. Testing framework expansion

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for modifier calculations
- Integration tests for combat system
- UI component testing
- State management validation
