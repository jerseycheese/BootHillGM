# API Integration

## Overview
This document describes the architecture and implementation details of external API integrations, particularly focusing on the Gemini API integration within the Boot Hill GM application.

## Purpose
This documentation serves as a technical reference for developers working on API integrations, providing insights into the architecture, implementation details, and best practices. It's particularly relevant for:
- Developers maintaining existing API integrations
- Engineers implementing new API connections
- Technical reviewers assessing the integration architecture

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Overview
The API integration follows a layered architecture:

```
Client Components → API Service Layer → External APIs
```

Key components:
- **API Service Layer**: Handles all external API communication
- **Authentication Manager**: Manages API keys and tokens
- **Rate Limiter**: Implements request throttling
- **Error Handler**: Standardizes error responses

### Integration Points

#### 1. AI Services
Location: `app/services/ai/`
- Handles Gemini API interactions
- Implements prompt engineering
- Manages conversation state

#### 2. Hooks
Location: `app/hooks/`
- `useAIInteractions.ts`: Main hook for AI interactions
- Provides abstraction layer for components
  - `CampaignStateManager.tsx`: Uses `getAIResponse` to fetch the initial narrative on game reset.

#### 3. Utilities
Location: `app/utils/`
- `aiService.tsx`: Core API service implementation
- `retry.ts`: Implements retry logic for failed requests

### Authentication
API authentication is handled through:
- Environment variables for API keys
- Secure storage using Next.js server-side mechanisms
- Token rotation for enhanced security

```typescript
// Example authentication setup
const apiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY;
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

### Error Handling
Standardized error responses include:
- HTTP status codes
- Error messages
- Retry information

```typescript
interface APIError {
  status: number;
  message: string;
  retryAfter?: number;
}
```

### Rate Limiting
Implemented using:
- Token bucket algorithm
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Queue system for high traffic periods

### Testing Strategy
API integration tests cover:
- Successful responses
- Error scenarios
- Rate limiting behavior
- Authentication failures

Tests are located in:
- `app/__tests__/services/`
- `app/__tests__/hooks/`
