# Data Persistence

## Overview
This document outlines the data persistence strategy for the Boot Hill GM application, including state management, local storage, and session management implementations.

## Purpose
This documentation serves as a technical reference for developers working on data persistence features, providing insights into the architecture, implementation details, and best practices. It's particularly relevant for:
- Developers maintaining state management systems
- Engineers implementing new data storage solutions
- Technical reviewers assessing data persistence architecture

## Implementation Details

### State Management Architecture
The application uses a centralized state management system with the following components:
- **Reducers**: Located in `app/reducers/`
- **Context Providers**: Implemented in `app/components/`
- **State Restoration**: Handled by hooks in `app/hooks/`

### Local Storage Implementation
Persistent data storage is implemented using:
- Browser localStorage API
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Data encryption for sensitive information

```typescript
// Example localStorage implementation
const saveState = (key: string, state: any) => {
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(state));
};

const loadState = (key: string) => {
  const state = localStorage.getItem(key);
  return state ? JSON.parse(state) : null;
};
```

### Session Management
Session data is managed through:
- React Context API
- Custom hooks for session state
- Automatic session expiration

### Data Protection
Security measures include:
- Encryption of sensitive data
- State validation on load
- Backup and restore functionality

```typescript
// Example state validation
interface ValidState {
  version: string;
  data: any;
}

const isValidState = (state: any): state is ValidState => {
  return state && state.version && state.data;
};
```

### Testing Strategy
Data persistence tests cover:
- State saving and loading
- Session management
- Data validation
- Error scenarios

Tests are located in:
- `app/__tests__/reducers/`
- `app/__tests__/hooks/`
