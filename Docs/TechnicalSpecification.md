# BootHillGM Technical Specification

## 1. Technical Stack
- Platform: Cross-platform mobile app using React Native
- AI Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro API (Google Generative AI)
- Development Environment: Visual Studio Code or WebStorm, Git for version control
- User Interface: React Native components for cross-platform UI
- State Management: Redux for global state management
- Data Persistence: AsyncStorage for simple data storage (MVP phase), with plans to expand to more robust solutions

## 2. AI Integration
- Primary Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro
- API: Google Generative AI API
- Integration Method: Custom implementation using Fetch API or Axios
- API Key Storage: Securely stored using react-native-config or a similar environment variable management solution

## 3. Architecture Overview
- React Native component-based architecture
- Redux for state management
- React Navigation for routing and navigation (to be implemented)
- Modular component design for maintainability and scalability

## 4. Key Components
1. Core Game Engine (GameCore): Manages game state, turns, and basic game flow. Integrated with Redux for state management.
2. AI Integration Service (AIManager): Handles communication with the Gemini API, manages context, and processes AI responses (to be implemented)
3. Character Management System: Manages character creation, attributes, skills, and progression (partially implemented in Redux)
4. Narrative Engine (NarrativeEngine): Generates and manages storylines, quests, and narrative elements (to be implemented)
5. Combat System (CombatSystem): Manages combat mechanics, turn order, and resolution (to be implemented)
6. Inventory System (InventorySystem): Manages items, equipment, and economy (basic structure implemented in Redux)
7. NPC Management (NPCManager): Generates and manages non-player characters (to be implemented)
8. Quest System (QuestSystem): Manages quest creation, tracking, and completion (basic structure implemented in Redux)
9. User Interface: Provides screens for character creation, game session, inventory, etc. (basic implementation in GameCore component)
10. Data Persistence (DataManager): Handles saving and loading game states, character data, and settings (to be implemented)

## 5. Data Flow
1. User interacts with the UI
2. UI components dispatch actions to Redux store
3. Redux middleware handles side effects (e.g., API calls)
4. Reducers update the state based on actions
5. UI components re-render based on state changes

## 6. AI Integration Approach
1. Develop a standardized interface for AI model interaction
2. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Optimize prompts for Western genre and Boot Hill RPG rules
4. Maintain context across user sessions
5. Implement efficient token usage strategies

## 7. Performance Considerations
- Implement logging for API usage
- Optimize prompt design for token efficiency
- Use caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Implement background processing for non-critical tasks
- Ensure smooth interactions between components to prevent bottlenecks

## 8. Security Measures
- Secure storage of API keys using react-native-config or similar solutions
- Implement HTTPS for all network requests
- Regular security audits and updates
- Implement data encryption for sensitive user data

## 9. Scalability Considerations
- Design modular components for easy feature additions
- Plan for potential multi-genre expansion in the future
- Consider serverless backend options for future multiplayer features
- Implement extensible data models to accommodate future game mechanics

## 10. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core logic components using Jest
- UI tests for critical user flows using React Native Testing Library
- Integration tests for AI service interactions
- Performance testing for response times and resource usage
- Stress testing for complex game scenarios

## 11. Current Implementation Status
The project has progressed beyond the initial planning phase. A basic React Native project structure has been set up, including:
- Implementation of Redux for state management
- Creation of a game slice with initial state and actions
- Development of a basic GameCore component integrated with Redux
- Simple UI elements to display and manipulate game state
