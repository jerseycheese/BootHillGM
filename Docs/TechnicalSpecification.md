# BootHillGM Technical Specification

## 1. Technical Stack
- Platform: iOS app using Swift and SwiftUI
- AI Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro API (Google Generative AI)
- Development Environment: Xcode for iOS development, Git for version control
- User Interface: SwiftUI for responsive and native iOS UI
- Data Persistence: UserDefaults for simple data storage (MVP phase), with plans to expand to more robust solutions

## 2. AI Integration
- Primary Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro
- API: Google Generative AI API
- Integration Method: GoogleGenerativeAI Swift package
- API Key Storage: Securely stored in GenerativeAI-Info.plist file (not tracked by Git)

## 3. Architecture Overview
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture
- SwiftUI for declarative UI
- Combine framework for reactive programming
- Modular component design for maintainability and scalability

## 4. Key Components
1. Core Game Engine (GameCore): Manages game state, turns, and basic game flow
   - TurnManager: Handles turn-based gameplay mechanics
2. AI Integration Service (AIManager): Handles communication with the Gemini API, manages context, and processes AI responses
3. Character Management System:
   - Character Model: Stores character data including attributes, skills, and conversation history
   - CharacterCreationViewModel: Manages the conversation-driven character creation process
4. Narrative Engine (NarrativeEngine): Generates and manages storylines, quests, and narrative elements
5. Combat System (CombatSystem): Manages combat mechanics, turn order, and resolution
6. Inventory System (InventorySystem): Manages items, equipment, and economy
7. NPC Management (NPCManager): Generates and manages non-player characters
8. Quest System (QuestSystem): Manages quest creation, tracking, and completion
9. User Interface:
   - CharacterCreationView: Provides a chat-like interface for AI-driven character creation
10. Data Persistence (DataManager): Handles saving and loading game states, character data, and settings

## 5. Data Flow
1. User interacts with the UI (e.g., CharacterCreationView)
2. ViewModel (e.g., CharacterCreationViewModel) processes user input and manages the conversation state
3. Character model is updated based on user responses
4. AIManager (to be implemented) will generate responses based on the conversation state and character data
5. ViewModel updates the UI with AI responses and prompts for further user input
6. Process repeats until character creation is complete

## 6. AI Integration Approach
1. Develop a standardized interface for AI model interaction
2. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Optimize prompts for Western genre and Boot Hill RPG rules
4. Maintain context across user sessions using conversation history
5. Implement efficient token usage strategies

## 7. Performance Considerations
- Implement logging for API usage
- Optimize prompt design for token efficiency
- Use caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Implement background processing for non-critical tasks
- Ensure smooth interactions between components to prevent bottlenecks

## 8. Security Measures
- Secure storage of API keys in GenerativeAI-Info.plist (not tracked by Git)
- Implement HTTPS for all network requests
- Regular security audits and updates
- Implement data encryption for sensitive user data

## 9. Scalability Considerations
- Design modular components for easy feature additions
- Plan for potential multi-genre expansion in the future
- Consider serverless backend options for future multiplayer features
- Implement extensible data models to accommodate future game mechanics

## 10. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core logic components and individual managers
- UI tests for critical user flows, including the conversation-driven character creation
- Integration tests for AI service interactions and inter-component communication
- Performance testing for response times and resource usage
- Stress testing for complex game scenarios

## 11. Current Implementation Status
- Character model implemented with basic attributes and conversation history
- CharacterCreationView and CharacterCreationViewModel implemented for conversation-driven character creation
- Placeholder logic for AI-driven conversation in place, ready for integration with actual AI service
