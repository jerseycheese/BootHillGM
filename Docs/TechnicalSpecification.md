# BootHillGM Technical Specification

## 1. Technical Stack
- Platform: iOS app using Swift and SwiftUI
- AI Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro API (Google Generative AI)
- Development Environment: Xcode for iOS development, Git for version control
- User Interface: SwiftUI for responsive and native iOS UI
- Data Persistence: UserDefaults for simple data storage (MVP phase), with plans to expand to more robust solutions

## 2. AI Integration
- Primary Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro
- API: Google Generative AI API
- Integration Method: GoogleGenerativeAI Swift package

## 3. Architecture Overview
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture
- SwiftUI for declarative UI
- Combine framework for reactive programming
- Modular component design for maintainability and scalability

## 4. Key Components
1. Core Game Engine (GameCore): Manages game state, turns, and basic game flow
2. AI Integration Service (AIManager): Handles communication with the Gemini API, manages context, and processes AI responses
3. Character Management System (CharacterManager): Manages character creation, attributes, skills, and progression
4. Narrative Engine (NarrativeEngine): Generates and manages storylines, quests, and narrative elements
5. Combat System (CombatSystem): Manages combat mechanics, turn order, and resolution
6. Inventory System (InventorySystem): Manages items, equipment, and economy
7. NPC Management (NPCManager): Generates and manages non-player characters
8. Quest System (QuestSystem): Manages quest creation, tracking, and completion
9. User Interface (UIManager): Manages all user interface elements and user interactions
10. Data Persistence (DataManager): Handles saving and loading game states, character data, and settings

## 5. Data Flow
1. User interacts with the UI (UIManager)
2. UIManager processes user input and communicates with relevant components
3. GameCore updates game state based on user actions and component interactions
4. AIManager generates responses based on game state, user input, and context from other components
5. Relevant components (e.g., NarrativeEngine, CombatSystem) process AI responses and update their states
6. GameCore coordinates updates across all components
7. UIManager reflects changes in the UI

## 6. AI Integration Approach
1. Develop a standardized interface for AI model interaction
2. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Optimize prompts for Western genre and Boot Hill RPG rules
4. Maintain context across user sessions
5. Implement efficient token usage strategies

## 7. Performance Considerations
- Implement logging for API usage
- Optimize prompt design for token efficiency
- Use caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Implement background processing for non-critical tasks
- Ensure smooth interactions between components to prevent bottlenecks

## 8. Security Measures
- Secure storage of API keys
- Implement HTTPS for all network requests
- Regular security audits and updates
- Implement data encryption for sensitive user data

## 9. Scalability Considerations
- Design modular components for easy feature additions
- Plan for potential multi-genre expansion in the future
- Consider serverless backend options for future multiplayer features
- Implement extensible data models to accommodate future game mechanics

## 10. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core logic components and individual managers
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Integration tests for AI service interactions and inter-component communication
- Performance testing for response times and resource usage
- Stress testing for complex game scenarios
