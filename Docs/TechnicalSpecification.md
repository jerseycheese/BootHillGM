# BootHillGM Technical Specification (MVP)

## 1. Technical Stack
- [ ] Framework: Next.js 14.x (React-based framework for web applications)
- [ ] Routing: Next.js App Router
- [ ] Programming Language: TypeScript 5.x for enhanced type safety
- [ ] AI Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro API (Google Generative AI)
- [ ] Development Environment: Visual Studio Code with ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Version Control: Git
- [ ] UI Components: Custom React components
- [ ] State Management: React Context API (for MVP)
- [ ] Styling: CSS Modules and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Data Persistence: localStorage for client-side storage (MVP phase)

## 2. Architecture Overview
- [ ] Next.js pages and API routes
- [ ] React component-based architecture
- [ ] Server-side rendering (SSR) for initial page load
- [ ] Client-side navigation for subsequent page transitions

## 3. Key Components
1. Pages (now using App Router):
   - Home (app/page.tsx)
   - Character Creation (app/character-creation/page.tsx)
   - Game Session (app/game-session/page.tsx)
   - Character Sheet (app/character-sheet/page.tsx)
2. Layout (app/layout.tsx): Defines the main layout for the application
3. Game Engine: Manages game state, turns, and basic game flow
4. AI Integration Service: Handles communication with the Gemini API
5. Character Management System: Manages character creation and stats
6. Narrative Engine: Generates basic storylines and dialogues
7. Combat System: Manages simplified combat mechanics
8. UI Components: Basic reusable React components

## 4. Data Flow
1. User interacts with the UI
2. Client-side components update local state or call API routes
3. API routes handle server-side logic, including AI interactions
4. Server responds with updated data
5. Client-side components re-render based on new data

## 5. AI Integration
- [ ] Implement basic interface for AI model interaction
- [ ] Design simple prompts for character creation, dialogue, and combat
- [ ] Implement error handling for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Maintain minimal context for the current game session

## 6. State Management
- [ ] Utilize React Context for global game state
- [ ] Implement reducers for state updates
- [ ] Store game state in localStorage for persistence

## 7. UI/UX Design
- [ ] Develop responsive layouts using CSS Modules
- [ ] Create basic UI components (buttons, inputs, cards)
- [ ] Implement simple animations for transitions (optional)

## 8. Performance Considerations
- [ ] Utilize Next.js built-in performance optimizations
- [ ] Implement basic caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize critical API routes for efficient processing

## 9. Security Measures
- [ ] Secure storage of API keys using Next.js environment variables
- [ ] Implement HTTPS for all network requests
- [ ] Use Next.js API routes to handle sensitive operations server-side

## 10. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Implement basic unit tests for core logic components
- [ ] Conduct manual testing for game scenarios and AI interactions

## 11. Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (optimized for Next.js applications)
- [ ] Set up basic continuous integration (CI) pipeline

## 12. Accessibility (Basic Considerations)
- [ ] Ensure proper heading structure and semantic HTML
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for essential functions
- [ ] Maintain sufficient color contrast for text readability

## 13. Performance Targets
- [ ] Initial page load time: < 3 seconds on average broadband
- [ ] Time to interactive: < 5 seconds
- [ ] API response time: < 1 second for non-AI operations
- [ ] AI response time: < 5 seconds for typical interactions

## 14. Browser Support
- [ ] Modern evergreen browsers (latest two versions)
- [ ] Basic functionality in IE11 (optional, if required for specific users)

## 15. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Implement basic error logging to console
- [ ] Set up simple analytics for usage tracking (e.g., Google Analytics)

This technical specification outlines the essential requirements for the BootHillGM MVP. It focuses on core functionality and maintainable architecture, suitable for implementation by a single developer new to React and Next.js. As development progresses and skills improve, this specification can be expanded to include more advanced features and optimizations.
