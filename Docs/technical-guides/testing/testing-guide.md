# React Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for testing React components in the BootHillGM project, following established patterns and best practices. It covers component tests, hook tests, integration tests, and snapshot tests with clear examples and guidelines.

## Testing Modules

The testing documentation is organized into focused modules:

1. **[[component-testing|Component Testing]]** - Testing React components of all types
2. **[[hook-testing|Hook Testing]]** - Testing custom hooks and hook dependencies
3. **[[integration-testing|Integration Testing]]** - Testing component interactions and API integrations
4. **[[snapshot-testing|Snapshot Testing]]** - Visual testing for UI components
5. **[[test-organization|Test Organization]]** - Folder structure and test organization

## Quick Reference

### Testing Technology Stack

- **Test Runner**: Jest
- **Testing Library**: React Testing Library
- **API Mocking**: MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- **DOM Assertions**: Jest-DOM

### Key Testing Principles

1. Test behavior, not implementation
2. Use accessible queries
3. Test edge cases and error states
4. Write isolated, independent tests
5. Mock external dependencies
6. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
7. Use proper async testing techniques
8. Keep snapshots focused and minimal

## Running Tests

For detailed information about running tests, see the [[test-configuration|Test Configuration]] document.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test/file.test.tsx

# Run tests matching a pattern
npm test -- -t "renders correctly"
```
