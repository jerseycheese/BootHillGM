# Weapons

The weapons types in BOOT HILL are representative of the various weapons used in the West from the times following the Civil War until about 1900. Each type of weapon can be employed up to its maximum range, although effectiveness will decrease as the target increases in range. The table below shows the various types of weapons and gives four range categories for use in determining hits or misses (see Hit Determination later in this section) as well as the reload rate for each. The reload rate shows the number of rounds that can be loaded into the weapon in a single turn. Reloading by a character is undertaken to the exclusion of all other activities except walking.
