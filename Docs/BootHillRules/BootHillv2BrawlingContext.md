# Boot Hill v2 Brawling Context

Brawling in Boot Hill v2 represents hand-to-hand combat, including fistfights, general melees, and bar-room brawls.

## Key Points
1. Brawling occurs after the firing portion of a game turn
2. Characters within 6 feet of each other can engage in brawling
3. Each brawling portion consists of two rounds
4. In each round, a character chooses to punch or grapple

## Procedure
1. Determine who has the first blow (highest speed ability, unless surprised)
2. First character chooses to punch or grapple and rolls on appropriate table
3. Apply effects of the action
4. Second character responds with punch or grapple after effects are determined
5. Repeat for a second round

## Special Considerations
- Weapons can be used as striking weapons in brawling
- Knife or cutting weapons use the PUNCHING table but refer to the WOUND chart for effects
- Other striking weapons (gun butts, chairs) add damage but reduce hit chance
- Holds (arm locks, head locks, bear hugs) require special rules to break

## Effects
- Damage reduces opponent's strength
- Some actions provide advantages or disadvantages in subsequent rounds
- Characters reaching 0 strength are knocked unconscious

Remember to refer to the PUNCHING TABLE and GRAPPLING TABLE for specific outcomes and effects of brawling actions.
