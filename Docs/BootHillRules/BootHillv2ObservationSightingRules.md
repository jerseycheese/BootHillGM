# Boot Hill v2 Observation and Sighting Rules

## Character Facing
- All characters must indicate their facing for observation and sighting purposes
- A character's field of view is defined by a 90° arc in the direction they are facing

## Observation During Movement
- When moving, a character can indicate desired facing
- Arc of observation is determined from the midpoint of the move
- No penalty for observation while moving due to the 10-second turn duration

## Visibility
- Characters can observe movement within their 90° arc
- Details may not be immediately noticeable
- Referee should interpret these rules flexibly

## Sighting for Combat
- A character may shoot at any target whose location they are aware of
- This includes anyone firing at the character, even if initially facing away
- Turning to fire at someone behind incurs a "total surprise" penalty

Note: These rules can be used in conjunction with Hidden Movement rules in more advanced play. The gamemaster should use discretion in applying these rules to maintain game balance and realism.

These rules are used in [BootHillv2CombatRules.md](BootHillv2CombatRules.md) for determining valid targets.
