# Boot Hill v2 Base Numbers Calculation

After determining character abilities and equipment, calculate two important base numbers:

## 1. First Shot Determination
This determines who shoots first in combat.

Calculation: Speed Ability Score + Bravery Speed Modifier + Weapon Speed Modifier

Example:
- Speed Ability Score: +12 (Very Fast)
- Bravery Speed Modifier: +1 (Above Average)
- Weapon Speed Modifier: +5 (Average speed weapon)
- Total First Shot Determination: 18

## 2. Hit Determination
This is the base chance to hit a target.

Calculation: Accuracy Ability Score + Bravery Accuracy Modifier + Experience Accuracy Modifier + 50

Example:
- Gun Accuracy Ability Score: +5 (Fair)
- Bravery Accuracy Modifier: +3 (Above Average)
- Experience Accuracy Modifier: -10 (No previous gunfights)
- Base Hit Determination: 48 (5 + 3 - 10 + 50)

Note: Calculate separate Hit Determination scores for firearms and thrown/launched weapons.

These base numbers will be modified by various factors (range, movement, wounds, etc.) during actual combat resolution.
