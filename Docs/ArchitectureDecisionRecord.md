# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR 1: Mobile App Architecture for BootHillGM

### Date: [Current Date]

### Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to design a scalable and maintainable architecture for the BootHillGM mobile app that can efficiently handle AI-driven game management, user interactions, and local data persistence. The architecture should support the unique requirements of a text-based RPG with AI integration and be deployable on both iOS and Android platforms.

## Considered Options

1. Native development (separate iOS and Android codebases)
2. React Native
3. Flutter
4. Xamarin

## Decision

We have decided to use React Native for the development of the BootHillGM mobile app.

## Rationale

- React Native allows for cross-platform development, reducing development time and maintenance efforts.
- It provides near-native performance while allowing for code reuse between platforms.
- React Native has a large and active community, providing access to numerous third-party libraries and resources.
- It allows for easy integration with native modules when needed for platform-specific functionality.
- The team's existing JavaScript/React knowledge can be leveraged, reducing the learning curve.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Faster development cycle with a single codebase for both iOS and Android.
- Easier maintenance and feature parity between platforms.
- Access to a wide range of third-party libraries and tools.
- Ability to use native modules for performance-critical or platform-specific features.
- Potential for web deployment in the future using React Native Web.

### Negative

- Potential performance overhead compared to fully native apps.
- Dependency on the React Native ecosystem and its updates.
- May require platform-specific code for some advanced features.
- Potential challenges with complex animations or highly custom UI elements.

## Related Decisions and Trade-offs

1. **State Management**: We'll use Redux for global state management due to its robust ecosystem and compatibility with React Native.

2. **Navigation**: We'll use React Navigation for its deep integration with React Native and extensive feature set.

3. **UI Components**: We'll primarily use React Native's built-in components, supplemented by carefully selected third-party libraries when necessary.

4. **Data Persistence**: For MVP, we'll use AsyncStorage for simple data storage. We may revisit this decision for more complex data needs post-MVP.

5. **AI Integration**: The AI service will be abstracted into its own service layer, interacting with Redux actions and reducers but not directly with React components.

## Additional Considerations

- We'll need to carefully manage the balance between cross-platform code and platform-specific optimizations.
- Regular updates of React Native and key dependencies will be crucial to maintain app performance and security.
- We'll need to implement comprehensive testing strategies that cover both platforms.

## Future Decisions to Consider

1. Implementation of a more robust data persistence solution post-MVP.
2. Strategies for handling long-running AI operations without blocking the UI.
3. Approach for integrating more complex, platform-specific features if required.

This ADR will be reviewed and updated as the project progresses and new architectural decisions are made.
