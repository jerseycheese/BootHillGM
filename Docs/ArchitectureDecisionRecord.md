# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR 1: Web Application Framework for BootHillGM

### Date: 10/1/2024

### Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to design a scalable and maintainable architecture for the BootHillGM application that can efficiently handle AI-driven game management, user interactions, and data persistence. The architecture should support the unique requirements of a text-based RPG with AI integration and be accessible across various devices.

## Considered Options

1. React Native (original choice)
2. Next.js
3. Plain React with Express backend
4. Vue.js with Nuxt.js

## Decision

We have decided to use Next.js for the development of the BootHillGM web application.

## Rationale

- Next.js provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) out of the box, improving performance and SEO capabilities.
- It offers a great developer experience with features like hot module replacement and automatic code splitting.
- Next.js has built-in API routes, allowing for easy implementation of serverless functions.
- The framework's file-based routing system simplifies navigation management.
- Next.js has excellent TypeScript support, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- It allows for easy deployment on platforms like Vercel, which is optimized for Next.js applications.
- The team's existing JavaScript/React knowledge can be leveraged, reducing the learning curve.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved performance and SEO capabilities through SSR and SSG.
- Simplified development process with built-in features like routing and API routes.
- Easier deployment and scaling options.
- Potential for better user experience across various devices due to web-based nature.
- Simplified testing process compared to mobile app development.

### Negative

- Loss of native mobile app features and offline capabilities (compared to the original React Native choice).
- Potential learning curve for team members not familiar with Next.js specifics.
- May require additional effort to make the application feel "app-like" on mobile devices.

## Related Decisions and Trade-offs

1. **State Management**: We'll start with React's Context API for global state management, with the option to introduce Redux if complexity increases.

2. **Styling**: We'll use CSS Modules for component-specific styles and consider using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

3. **API Routes**: We'll leverage Next.js API routes for server-side operations and AI interactions.

4. **Data Persistence**: We'll use a combination of client-side storage (localStorage) and server-side storage (database) depending on the data sensitivity and persistence requirements.

5. **Authentication**: We'll implement authentication using Next.js middleware and consider using NextAuth.js for more complex auth flows.

## Additional Considerations

- We'll need to optimize the web application for mobile devices to ensure a good user experience across all platforms.
- Regular updates of Next.js and key dependencies will be crucial to maintain app performance and security.
- We'll implement progressive enhancement techniques to support a wide range of browsers and devices.

## Future Decisions to Consider

1. Implementation of a more robust data persistence solution post-MVP.
2. Strategies for handling long-running AI operations without blocking the UI.
3. Approach for implementing "app-like" features such as offline support and push notifications.

This ADR will be reviewed and updated as the project progresses and new architectural decisions are made.
