# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR 1: Mobile App Architecture for BootHillGM

### Date: [Current Date]

### Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to design a scalable and maintainable architecture for the BootHillGM iOS app that can efficiently handle AI-driven game management, user interactions, and local data persistence. The architecture should support the unique requirements of a text-based RPG with AI integration.

## Considered Options

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
2. Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
3. View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router (VIPER)
4. The Composable Architecture (TCA)

## Decision

We have decided to use the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for the BootHillGM iOS app.

## Rationale

- MVVM provides a clear separation of concerns, which is crucial for managing the complex logic of an AI-driven RPG.
- It works well with SwiftUI, our chosen UI framework, which has built-in support for binding data to views.
- MVVM facilitates easier unit testing, particularly for business logic contained in ViewModels.
- It offers a good balance between simplicity and scalability, suitable for both MVP development and future expansions.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of UI logic (View) from business logic (ViewModel) and data (Model).
- Improved testability, especially for complex game logic and AI interactions.
- Better maintainability and readability of code.
- Easier to implement reactive programming patterns using Combine framework.

### Negative

- Potential for overloaded ViewModels if not carefully managed.
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with MVVM.
- Slightly more boilerplate code compared to MVC.

## Related Decisions and Trade-offs

1. **UI Framework**: We've chosen SwiftUI for its declarative syntax and built-in state management, which pairs well with MVVM.

2. **State Management**: We'll use Combine framework for reactive programming, complementing the MVVM architecture.

3. **Dependency Injection**: We'll implement a simple dependency injection system to facilitate testing and modular development.

4. **Data Persistence**: For MVP, we'll use UserDefaults for simple data storage. We may revisit this decision for more complex data needs post-MVP.

5. **AI Integration**: The AI service will be abstracted into its own service layer, interacting with ViewModels but not directly with Views.

## Additional Considerations

- We'll need to carefully design the interaction between the game state, AI service, and ViewModels to ensure efficient updates and avoid unnecessary API calls.
- As the project grows, we may need to implement additional patterns (e.g., Coordinator pattern for navigation) to complement the MVVM architecture.
- Regular architecture reviews will be necessary to ensure we're not overloading ViewModels or violating MVVM principles as new features are added.

## Future Decisions to Consider

1. Implementation of a more robust data persistence solution post-MVP.
2. Strategies for handling long-running AI operations without blocking the UI.
3. Approach for modularizing the app if complexity significantly increases.

This ADR will be reviewed and updated as the project progresses and new architectural decisions are made.
