## Recommended Development Order (MVP Focus)

1. Pages and basic UI Components
2. API Routes
3. Core Game Engine (GameCore)
4. Character Management System
5. AI Integration Service (AIService)
6. Narrative Engine (NarrativeEngine)
7. Combat System (CombatSystem)
8. Inventory System (InventorySystem)
9. NPC Management (NPCManager)
10. Quest System (QuestSystem)
11. Data Persistence (DataManager)

This order allows for building core functionality first, then adding more complex systems. The UI components and pages are placed early to allow for testing and iterating on user interactions. Data Persistence is last as it depends on other components being relatively stable.

Note: While developing these components, work on multiple components may occur simultaneously due to their interconnected nature. This order is a general guideline and may need adjustment based on specific implementation details or challenges that arise during development.
