# BootHillGM Component Breakdown

This document outlines the main components of the BootHillGM project, their functionalities, potential challenges, and interactions. It also suggests a logical order for development.

## Components

### 1. Core Game Engine (GameCore)
- **Main Functionality:** Manages game state, turns, and basic game flow (including TurnManager functionality)
- **Potential Challenges:** Ensuring thread safety, handling complex state changes
- **Interactions:** Interacts with almost all other components, especially AIManager and CharacterManager

### 2. AI Integration Service (AIManager)
- **Main Functionality:** Handles communication with Gemini API, manages context, and processes AI responses
- **Potential Challenges:** Optimizing prompts, handling API errors, managing token usage
- **Interactions:** Interacts with GameCore, NarrativeEngine, and NPCManager

### 3. Character Management System (CharacterManager)
- **Main Functionality:** Handles character creation, attributes, skills, and progression
- **Potential Challenges:** Implementing Boot Hill RPG rules accurately, balancing character progression
- **Interactions:** Interacts with GameCore, InventorySystem, and CombatSystem

### 4. Narrative Engine (NarrativeEngine)
- **Main Functionality:** Generates and manages storylines, quests, and narrative elements
- **Potential Challenges:** Creating engaging and coherent narratives, integrating player choices
- **Interactions:** Interacts with AIManager, GameCore, and QuestSystem

### 5. Combat System (CombatSystem)
- **Main Functionality:** Manages combat mechanics, turn order, and resolution
- **Potential Challenges:** Implementing Boot Hill's quick-action combat system, balancing difficulty
- **Interactions:** Interacts with GameCore, CharacterManager, and AIManager

### 6. Inventory System (InventorySystem)
- **Main Functionality:** Manages items, equipment, and economy
- **Potential Challenges:** Balancing economy, implementing item effects
- **Interactions:** Interacts with CharacterManager and GameCore

### 7. NPC Management (NPCManager)
- **Main Functionality:** Generates and manages non-player characters
- **Potential Challenges:** Creating diverse and interesting NPCs, managing NPC persistence
- **Interactions:** Interacts with AIManager, NarrativeEngine, and GameCore

### 8. Quest System (QuestSystem)
- **Main Functionality:** Manages quest creation, tracking, and completion
- **Potential Challenges:** Integrating quests with the narrative, handling quest dependencies
- **Interactions:** Interacts with NarrativeEngine, GameCore, and CharacterManager

### 9. User Interface (UIManager)
- **Main Functionality:** Manages all user interface elements and user interactions
- **Potential Challenges:** Creating an intuitive text-based interface, handling dynamic content
- **Interactions:** Interacts with all other components to display information and gather user input

### 10. Data Persistence (DataManager)
- **Main Functionality:** Handles saving and loading game states, character data, and settings
- **Potential Challenges:** Efficiently storing complex game states, handling data migrations
- **Interactions:** Interacts with all components that need data persistence

## Recommended Development Order

1. Core Game Engine (GameCore)
2. AI Integration Service (AIManager)
3. Character Management System (CharacterManager)
4. User Interface (UIManager)
5. Combat System (CombatSystem)
6. Inventory System (InventorySystem)
7. NPC Management (NPCManager)
8. Narrative Engine (NarrativeEngine)
9. Quest System (QuestSystem)
10. Data Persistence (DataManager)

This order allows for building core functionality first, then adding more complex systems. The UI is placed early to allow for testing and iterating on user interactions. Data Persistence is last as it depends on all other components being relatively stable.

Note: While developing these components, work on multiple components may occur simultaneously due to their interconnected nature. This order is a general guideline and may need adjustment based on specific implementation details or challenges that arise during development.
