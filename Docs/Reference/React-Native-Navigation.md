# React Native Navigation: In-Depth Summary

## Core Concepts

Screens: The individual views or pages that make up your app's user interface.
Navigation Stack: A collection of screens managed by a navigator, representing the app's navigation history.
Navigators: Components responsible for managing the navigation stack and transitions between screens.

## React Navigation Library

The recommended solution for handling navigation in React Native.

Provides a declarative and flexible approach to defining navigation structures.

Offers various navigators to suit different app architectures:

### Stack Navigator:

Manages a stack of screens, ideal for hierarchical navigation (e.g., drill-down flows).
Key components: `createStackNavigator`, `NavigationContainer`, `Stack.Screen`.
Common props: `initialRouteName`, `screenOptions`, `headerShown`.

### Tab Navigator:

Creates a tab-based navigation structure, typically used for the main sections of an app.
Key components: `createBottomTabNavigator`, `NavigationContainer`, `Tab.Screen`.
Common props: `tabBarOptions`, `screenOptions`, `initialRouteName`.

### Drawer Navigator:

Implements a side menu (drawer) for navigation, often used for settings or secondary features.
Key components: `createDrawerNavigator`, `NavigationContainer`, `Drawer.Screen`.
Common props: `drawerContent`, `screenOptions`, `initialRouteName`.

## Navigating Between Screens

`navigation` prop: Passed to each screen component, providing methods for navigating:

- `navigate('ScreenName')`: Pushes a new screen onto the stack.
- `goBack()`: Pops the current screen from the stack.
- `replace('ScreenName')`: Replaces the current screen with a new one.
- `reset(...)`: Resets the navigation state to a specified configuration.

Passing Data:

- Params: Pass data to the next screen using the `params` object in `navigate`.
- Route props: Access params and other navigation-related information through the `route` prop.

## Advanced Features

- Nested Navigators: Combine different navigators to create complex navigation structures.
- Custom Navigators: Build your own navigators for specific use cases.
- Deep Linking: Handle links that open specific screens within your app.
- Navigation Events: Listen for navigation events (e.g., focus, blur) to trigger actions.

Key Points:

- React Navigation offers a declarative and flexible way to manage navigation.
- Choose the appropriate navigator(s) based on your app's structure and user experience.
- Utilize the `navigation` prop to navigate between screens and pass data.
- Explore advanced features for more complex navigation scenarios.
