## 1. Development Environment

### 1.1 React Native CLI
- Use the React Native Command Line Interface (CLI) for creating and managing projects.
- Take advantage of hot reloading to see changes instantly without recompiling the entire app.

### 1.2 Expo
- Consider using Expo for simplified development and access to native APIs without writing native code.
- Utilize Expo Go app for real-time testing and debugging on physical devices and emulators.
- Leverage Expo's over-the-air (OTA) update capability for pushing updates directly to users' devices.

## 2. Code Organization and Structure

### 2.1 Use TypeScript
- Implement TypeScript for static typing, which leads to more reliable code and helps catch bugs during compilation.
- Define interfaces for complex objects to enhance code readability and prevent runtime errors.

Example:
```typescript
interface Order {
  price: number;
  name: string;
  taxPercentage: number;
}

function calculatePrice(order: Order) {
  const { price, taxPercentage } = order;
  const taxValue = price * taxPercentage;
  return price + taxValue;
}
```

### 2.2 Prefer Functional Components
- Use functional components over class components for simplicity, conciseness, and potential performance improvements.
- Utilize React Hooks for state management and side effects in functional components.

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const FunctionalComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text style={styles.h1}>Functional Component</Text>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title='Increment' onPress={incrementCount}/>
    </View>
  );
};
```

### 2.3 Organize Imports
- Order imports consistently to improve code readability:
  1. External imports (e.g., React, React Native)
  2. Internal imports (relative paths)
  3. In-folder imports
- Sort imports alphabetically within each group
- Separate import groups with a blank line
- Use ESLint and Prettier to automate and enforce correct import order

Example:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { TouchableOpacity, View } from 'react-native';

import { Button, Card } from '../components';
import { MainLayout } from '../layouts';

import { StyledCard } from './styles.ts';
```

### 2.4 Use Path Aliases
- Implement path aliases to create shorter and more meaningful import paths, especially for deep or nested folder structures.
- Configure path aliases in both TypeScript (tsconfig.json) and React Native (babel.config.js) settings.

## 3. Component Design and Structure

### 3.1 Component Reusability
- Break down your UI into smaller, reusable components.
- Promotes code maintainability, readability, and testability.
- Consider using Atomic Design principles for a structured component hierarchy.

### 3.2 Separation of Concerns
- Keep your components focused on specific tasks (presentation, logic, data fetching).
- Improves code organization and reduces complexity.
- Use custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic.

### 3.3 Prop Types
- Define prop types for your components using PropTypes or TypeScript.
- Enhances code reliability by catching type errors early.
- Improves documentation and understanding of component interfaces.

## 4. User Interface (UI) Design

### 4.1 Design Consistency
- Use a consistent design language throughout the app.
- Implement a design system or style guide.
- Utilize component libraries for consistent UI elements.

### 4.2 Responsive Design
- Ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Use libraries like react-native-normalize to create responsive layouts effortlessly.
- Implement responsive style properties using functions to create adaptive layouts.

### 4.3 Visual Assets
- Use high-resolution images and icons.
- Implement lazy loading techniques for better performance.

### 4.4 Animations and Styling
- Use libraries like Lottie for sophisticated animations.
- Consider using Styled-Components for writing CSS in JavaScript.

### 4.5 Theming
- Implement theming using libraries like 'styled-components'.
- Consider adding a dark mode option.

### 4.6 Accessibility
- Follow accessibility best practices.
- Use semantic elements, alt text, and screen reader support.
- Utilize native accessibility tools when necessary.

## 5. Styling and Layout

### 5.1 StyleSheet
- Use StyleSheet for defining styles whenever possible.
- Improves performance by caching styles and preventing inline style recalculations.
- Promotes a consistent and maintainable styling approach.

### 5.2 Flexbox
- Master flexbox for flexible and responsive layouts.
- Understand key properties like `flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, `alignItems`, and `flex`.
- Utilize `flex: 1` for filling available space and creating adaptable layouts.

### 5.3 Platform-Specific Styling
- Handle platform-specific styling differences using `Platform.OS` or platform-specific extensions (`.ios.js`,`.android.js`).
- Ensures a consistent look and feel across both iOS and Android platforms.

## 6. State Management

### 6.1 Choose the Right Approach
- Select a state management solution that aligns with your app's complexity.
- Use `useState` for local component state, Context API for shared state, and consider Redux or other libraries for complex state management.

### 6.2 Immutability
- Update state immutably to avoid unintended side effects and improve performance.
- Use the spread operator (`...`) or libraries like Immer to create new state objects.

## 7. Performance Optimization

### 7.1 Avoid Inline Functions
- Inline functions can lead to unnecessary re-renders and increased memory usage.
- Extract functions outside of component definitions to prevent re-creation on each render.

### 7.2 Use useCallback for Function Memoization
- Utilize the `useCallback` hook to memoize callback functions.
- This prevents unnecessary re-renders in child components that rely on reference equality.

### 7.3 Leverage useMemo for Complex Calculations
- Use the `useMemo` hook to memoize the results of expensive calculations.
- This prevents unnecessary recalculations on each render.

### 7.4 Optimize Component Re-renders with React.memo
