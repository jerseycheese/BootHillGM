# BootHillGM AI Game Master Logic Document

## 1. Overview
The AI Game Master (GM) is the core component of BootHillGM, responsible for creating and managing the game world, narrating the story, and facilitating player interactions within the Boot Hill RPG framework. This document outlines the logic and considerations for implementing the AI GM in a Next.js web application environment.

## 2. Core Functions (MVP)

### 2.1 Narrative Generation
- [ ] Create a linear main storyline with minimal branching
- [ ] Generate descriptive text for locations, characters, and events
- [ ] Adapt narrative based on player choices within predefined story points

### 2.2 Character Interaction
- [ ] Generate basic NPC dialogues based on predefined personality types
- [ ] Respond to player inputs in a context-appropriate manner
- [ ] Maintain consistency in NPC behavior throughout a game session

### 2.3 Game Mechanics Implementation
- [ ] Interpret and apply simplified Boot Hill RPG rules
- [ ] Manage skill checks and combat resolution
- [ ] Track and update game state (character stats, inventory, quest progress)

### 2.4 World Management
- [ ] Maintain a small-scale persistent world state (one town and immediate surroundings)
- [ ] Manage time progression and basic environmental changes

## 3. AI Model Integration

### 3.1 Prompt Engineering
- [ ] Design a set of base prompts for common game scenarios (e.g., combat, dialogue, exploration)
- [ ] Include relevant Boot Hill RPG rules and Western setting details in prompts
- [ ] Implement a system to dynamically construct prompts based on current game state

### 3.2 Context Management
- [ ] Maintain a running context of recent game events and player actions
- [ ] Implement a summarization mechanism to keep context within token limits
- [ ] Periodically refresh the AI's understanding of the current game state

## 4. Game Master Personality

### 4.1 Tone and Style
- [ ] Adopt a neutral, descriptive tone for narration
- [ ] Use period-appropriate language and terminology for the Old West setting
- [ ] Maintain an impartial stance towards player actions

### 4.2 Consistency
- [ ] Implement checks to ensure narrative and mechanical consistency
- [ ] Maintain a log of key decisions and events for reference

## 5. Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

### 5.1 Input Interpretation
- [ ] Implement fuzzy matching for player inputs to handle minor typos or variations
- [ ] Provide clarification prompts when player intent is unclear

### 5.2 Output Validation
- [ ] Check AI-generated content for relevance and appropriateness
- [ ] Implement fallback responses for cases where AI output is unsuitable

### 5.3 Connection Issues
- [ ] Gracefully handle API timeouts or failures
- [ ] Provide offline fallback options for critical game functions

## 6. Boot Hill RPG Specific Logic

### 6.1 Character Creation
- [ ] Guide players through the character creation process
- [ ] Generate appropriate starting equipment based on character background

### 6.2 Skill Checks
- [ ] Interpret player actions and determine appropriate skills to test
- [ ] Apply Boot Hill's percentile dice system for resolution

### 6.3 Combat System
- [ ] Manage turn order and initiative
- [ ] Resolve attacks and damage using Boot Hill's combat rules
- [ ] Narrate combat outcomes in an engaging manner

## 7. Web Application Considerations

### 7.1 State Management
- [ ] Utilize React Context or Redux for managing global game state
- [ ] Implement efficient state updates to minimize unnecessary re-renders

### 7.2 API Integration
- [ ] Use Next.js API routes for server-side AI interactions
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and loading states for API calls

### 7.3 User Interface
- [ ] Design a responsive interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions between different game states and screens

## 8. Performance Optimization

### 8.1 Response Time Optimization
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently used game data
- [ ] Optimize prompt construction to minimize token usage
- [ ] Use Next.js performance features like automatic code splitting and lazy loading

### 8.2 Memory Management
- [ ] Implement efficient storage and retrieval of game state
- [ ] Regularly prune non-essential information from the AI context
- [ ] Utilize server-side storage for long-term data persistence

## 9. Accessibility and Internationalization

### 9.1 Accessibility
- [ ] Ensure all game text is screen reader friendly
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for all game functions
- [ ] Provide options for adjusting text size and contrast

### 9.2 Internationalization
- [ ] Design the system to support multiple languages in the future
- [ ] Use translation keys instead of hardcoded strings

## 10. Future Expansions (Post-MVP)

### 10.1 Advanced Narrative Techniques
- [ ] Implement branching storylines with long-term consequences
- [ ] Develop dynamic quest generation based on player actions and world state

### 10.2 Enhanced NPC System
- [ ] Create more complex NPC personalities with goals and motivations
- [ ] Implement a reputation system affecting NPC interactions

### 10.3 Expanded World Simulation
- [ ] Manage multiple locations with interconnected events and economies
- [ ] Implement a more sophisticated time progression system

### 10.4 Player Adaptation
- [ ] Analyze player behavior to tailor game difficulty and story pacing
- [ ] Implement a learning system to improve AI responses over time

This document serves as a guide for implementing the AI Game Master in a Next.js web application environment. The actual implementation may evolve based on technical constraints, player feedback, and emerging best practices in AI integration within web applications.
