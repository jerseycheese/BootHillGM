## Purpose
This document serves as the central reference for the game's design, providing:
- A comprehensive overview of game systems and mechanics
- Implementation details for core features
- Design principles and guidelines
- Technical specifications and architecture
- Development priorities and testing focus

# Game Design Document

## Overview
BootHillGM is an AI-driven, web-based RPG set in the American Old West, based on the Boot Hill tabletop RPG system. Players engage in a solo adventure guided by an AI Game Master that provides uncensored, authentic Western storytelling through a responsive web interface.

For implementation details, see:
- [[../core-systems/combat-system|Combat System]]
- [[../core-systems/state-management|State Management]]
- [[../core-systems/journal-system|Journal System]]
- [[../core-systems/ai-integration|AI Integration]]

## Core Design Principles
- Uncensored storytelling that adapts to all player actions
- Faithful adaptation of Boot Hill RPG mechanics
- Clear and responsive web-based interface
- Persistent game state with automatic saving
- Seamless integration of AI responses with game mechanics
- Theme-aware storytelling focusing on survival, law vs. outlaw, and frontier justice
- Dynamic narrative adaptation based on player actions and relevant themes

## Current Features

### Character System
- AI-guided character creation
- Boot Hill attribute system
- Character state persistence
- Equipment and inventory management
- AI-generated character backgrounds
- Inventory and ammunition properties for characters and weapons

For implementation details, see [[../features/_completed/character-creation|Character Creation]].

### Game Session Management
- Real-time narrative generation
- Context-aware AI responses
- Automatic state saving
- Journal system for tracking events
- Combat state restoration
- Dynamic suggested actions generated by AI based on:
  - Character background
  - Current location and situation
  - Available inventory items
  - Recent narrative events
- Contextual suggestions update throughout gameplay
- Fallback system ensures players always have action options

### Combat System
- Turn-based combat following Boot Hill rules
- Health and damage tracking
- Combat log with detailed actions
- Weapon-specific modifiers
- Combat state persistence
- Auto-processing of opponent turns with basic AI
- Wound system with severity levels (light, serious, mortal)
- Refactored aim, move, and reload actions

For combat rules, see [[../BootHillRules/CombatRules|Boot Hill Combat Rules]].

### Inventory System
- Item tracking and management
- Use item functionality
- Quantity tracking
- Item descriptions
- Automatic updates from narrative

For current work, see [[../features/_current/inventory-interactions|Inventory Interactions]].

### Journal System
- Automatic entry creation
- Combat result tracking
- Narrative summaries
- Timestamp organization
- Action history preservation

For enhancements, see [[../features/_current/journal-enhancements|Journal Enhancements]].

## Technical Implementation

### User Interface
- Main Game Area
  - Narrative display
  - Input controls
  - Combat interface
- Side Panel
  - Character status
  - Inventory display
  - Journal viewer
- Game Controls
  - Action buttons
  - Save functionality
  - System messages

For UI details, see [[../architecture/ui-wireframes|UI Wireframes]].

### State Management
- Campaign state provider
- Combat state handling
- Inventory management
- Journal tracking
- Automatic saving

For architecture details, see [[../architecture/state-management|State Management Architecture]].

### AI Integration
- Context management
- Response parsing
- Prompt engineering
- Error handling
- State synchronization

For AI details, see [[../ai/gemini-integration|Gemini Integration]].

## Game Mechanics

### Core Loop
1. Player inputs action
2. AI processes and generates response
3. Game state updates based on response
4. UI updates to reflect changes
5. State is automatically saved
6. Loop continues with next player action

### Combat Loop
1. Initiative determination
2. Turn-based actions (player then opponent)
3. Damage calculation with wound application
4. State updates
5. Combat log updates
6. Victory/defeat conditions (based on strength or mortal wounds)
7. State restoration if interrupted

### Inventory Management
1. Automatic item acquisition from narrative
2. Manual item usage
3. Quantity tracking
4. State updates
5. Journal entry creation

## Content Guidelines
