- [x] Implement dispatch function for all state updates

2.2 AI Integration
- [x] Set up Gemini API integration
- [x] Implement basic AI response generation using Next.js API routes
- [x] Develop simple context management for game elements
- [x] Implement uncensored AI responses for unrestricted player agency

2.3 Character System
- [x] Implement simplified character creation flow
- [x] Implement AI-driven random character generation
- [x] Create basic character sheet display

2.4 User Interface
- [x] Design and implement essential UI components
- [x] Develop responsive layout for game session page
- [x] Implement wireframe styling across all pages

## Phase 3: Game Mechanics Implementation

3.1 Narrative Engine
- [x] Develop basic story generation system
- [x] Implement simple dialogue system
- [x] Ensure AI adapts to all player actions without censorship

3.2 Combat System
- [x] Implement simplified Boot Hill combat rules
- [x] Create basic combat UI
- [x] Implement turn-based combat flow
- [x] Add health tracking for player and opponent
- [x] Create combat log for narrating fight progression
- [ ] Implement critical hits and misses
- [ ] Add combat-specific inventory interactions (e.g., weapon switching, item usage)

3.3 Inventory System
- [x] Implement basic inventory data structure
- [x] Create Inventory component for displaying items
- [x] Implement add and remove item functionality
- [ ] Implement item usage functionality
- [ ] Add item usage restrictions and logical checks
  - Prevent usage of items not in inventory
  - Provide feedback for attempted use of unavailable items
- [ ] Integrate inventory with other game systems (e.g., combat)

3.4 Character Summary
- [x] Implement character summary generation
- [x] Integrate summary display in character creation process

3.5 Campaign Persistence
- [ ] Design and implement CampaignStateManager
- [ ] Integrate campaign state saving/loading into GameSession component
- [ ] Implement basic journal system for tracking important story information
- [ ] Update AI service to use journal context in prompts

## Phase 4: Data Persistence and Refinement

4.1 Save/Load Functionality

- [ ] Create save/load system using localStorage
- [ ] Add error handling for save/load operations
- [ ] Test save/load functionality across different scenarios

4.2 Bug Fixes and Optimizations
- [ ] Address any bugs or issues discovered during development
- [ ] Optimize performance of critical game loops
- [ ] Optimize journal context selection for AI prompts

4.3 Polish UI/UX
- [ ] Refine user interface based on playtesting feedback
- [ ] Improve responsiveness across different devices
- [ ] Add UI elements for viewing journal entries (if time permits)

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

5.1 Testing
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests for core logic components
  - [ ] Game Engine functions
  - [ ] AI Integration Service methods
  - [ ] Character Management System
  - [ ] Narrative Engine
  - [ ] Combat System
  - [ ] Inventory System
  - [ ] Campaign State Manager
  - [ ] Journal System
- [ ] Implement integration tests for key user flows
  - [ ] Character Creation flow
  - [ ] Game Session initialization
  - [ ] Player input and AI response cycle
  - [ ] Combat initiation and resolution
  - [ ] Inventory management
  - [ ] Saving and loading game state
- [ ] Set up and run test coverage reporting
- [ ] Aim for at least 80% test coverage across the application
- [ ] Conduct thorough playtesting
- [ ] Fix critical bugs and issues
- [ ] Test combat system extensively for balance and engagement

5.2 Deployment
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline (e.g., Vercel)
- [ ] Deploy MVP version for limited release

## Ongoing Tasks
- Regular code reviews and refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Learning and applying React and Next.js best practices
- Continuously improve AI prompt engineering for better storytelling

## Post-MVP Considerations
- Expand narrative complexity
- Enhance AI interactions
- Implement more advanced combat and inventory systems
- Add user authentication and profiles
- Develop multi-campaign management
- Consider implementing content warnings or age verification for uncensored content
- Implement a more complex NPC system with relationships and factions
- Add environmental factors to combat (weather, terrain)
- Enhance combat system with more complex actions (e.g., dodging, using cover)
- Enhance combat UI with animations and sound effects

Note: This roadmap is designed to be flexible. Adjust timelines and priorities as you progress and gain more experience with React and Next.js. Regular review and revision of this roadmap is recommended as you better understand the development process and challenges.
