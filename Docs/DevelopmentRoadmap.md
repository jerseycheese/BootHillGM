# BootHillGM Development Roadmap (MVP Focus)

This roadmap outlines the development phases for the BootHillGM MVP, tailored for implementation by a single developer new to React and Next.js.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Learning

1.1 Environment Setup
- [x] Set up Next.js development environment
- [x] Configure TypeScript
- [x] Set up version control with Git

1.2 Learning and Experimentation
- [x] Complete Next.js tutorial
- [x] Experiment with basic React concepts (components, props, state)
- [x] Learn about React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)

1.3 Project Structure
- [x] Set up basic Next.js project structure
- [x] Create initial pages (Home, Character Creation, Game Session)
- [x] Experiment with API routes

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Development

2.1 State Management
- [x] Implement basic game state using React Context
- [x] Create reducers for state updates

2.2 AI Integration
- [x] Set up Gemini API integration
- [x] Implement basic AI response generation using Next.js API routes
- [x] Develop simple context management for game elements
- [x] Implement uncensored AI responses for unrestricted player agency

2.3 Character System
- [x] Implement simplified character creation flow
- [x] Implement AI-driven random character generation
- [x] Create basic character sheet display

2.4 User Interface
- [x] Design and implement essential UI components
- [x] Develop responsive layout for game session page
- [x] Implement wireframe styling across all pages

## Phase 3: Game Mechanics Implementation

3.1 Narrative Engine
- [ ] Develop basic story generation system
- [ ] Implement simple dialogue system
- [x] Ensure AI adapts to all player actions without censorship

3.2 Combat System
- [ ] Implement simplified Boot Hill combat rules
- [ ] Create basic combat UI

3.3 Inventory System
- [ ] Implement basic item management
- [ ] Create simple inventory UI

3.4 Character Summary
- [x] Implement character summary generation
- [x] Integrate summary display in character creation process

3.5 Campaign Persistence
- [ ] Design and implement CampaignStateManager
- [ ] Integrate campaign state saving/loading into GameSession component
- [ ] Implement basic journal system for tracking important story information
- [ ] Update AI service to use journal context in prompts

## Phase 4: Data Persistence and Refinement

4.1 Save/Load Functionality
- [ ] Implement campaign state serialization
- [ ] Create save/load system using localStorage
- [ ] Add error handling for save/load operations
- [ ] Test save/load functionality across different scenarios

4.2 Bug Fixes and Optimizations
- [ ] Address any bugs or issues discovered during development
- [ ] Optimize performance of critical game loops
- [ ] Optimize journal context selection for AI prompts

4.3 Polish UI/UX
- [ ] Refine user interface based on playtesting feedback
- [ ] Improve responsiveness across different devices
- [ ] Add UI elements for viewing journal entries (if time permits)

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

5.1 Testing
- [ ] Conduct thorough playtesting
- [ ] Fix critical bugs and issues

5.2 Deployment
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline (e.g., Vercel)
- [ ] Deploy MVP version for limited release

## Ongoing Tasks
- Regular code reviews and refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Learning and applying React and Next.js best practices
- Continuously improve AI prompt engineering for better storytelling

## Post-MVP Considerations
- Expand narrative complexity
- Enhance AI interactions
- Implement more advanced combat and inventory systems
- Add user authentication and profiles
- Develop multi-campaign management
- Consider implementing content warnings or age verification for uncensored content

Note: This roadmap is designed to be flexible. Adjust timelines and priorities as you progress and gain more experience with React and Next.js. Regular review and revision of this roadmap is recommended as you better understand the development process and challenges.
