# BootHillGM Development Roadmap (MVP Focus)

This roadmap outlines the development phases for the BootHillGM MVP, tailored for implementation by a single developer new to React and Next.js.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Learning (2-3 weeks)

1.1 Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up Next.js development environment
- [ ] Configure TypeScript
- [ ] Set up version control with Git

1.2 Learning and Experimentation
- [ ] Complete Next.js tutorial
- [ ] Experiment with basic React concepts (components, props, state)
- [ ] Learn about React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)

1.3 Project Structure
- [ ] Set up basic Next.js project structure
- [ ] Create initial pages (Home, Character Creation, Game Session)
- [ ] Experiment with API routes

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Development (4-6 weeks)

2.1 State Management
- [ ] Implement basic game state using React Context
- [ ] Create reducers for state updates

2.2 AI Integration
- [ ] Set up Gemini API integration
- [ ] Implement basic AI response generation using Next.js API routes
- [ ] Develop simple context management for game elements

2.3 Character System
- [ ] Implement simplified character creation flow
- [ ] Create basic character sheet display

2.4 User Interface
- [ ] Design and implement essential UI components
- [ ] Develop responsive layout for game session page

## Phase 3: Game Mechanics Implementation (4-6 weeks)

3.1 Narrative Engine
- [ ] Develop basic story generation system
- [ ] Implement simple dialogue system

3.2 Combat System
- [ ] Implement simplified Boot Hill combat rules

5.2 Deployment
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline (e.g., Vercel)
- [ ] Deploy MVP version for limited release

## Ongoing Tasks
- Regular code reviews and refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Learning and applying React and Next.js best practices

## Post-MVP Considerations
- Expand narrative complexity
- Enhance AI interactions
- Implement more advanced combat and inventory systems
- Add user authentication and profiles
- Develop multi-campaign management

Note: This roadmap is designed to be flexible. Adjust timelines and priorities as you progress and gain more experience with React and Next.js. Regular review and revision of this roadmap is recommended as you better understand the development process and challenges.
