# State Migration Completed

This document summarizes the implementation of the refined state management architecture for BootHillGM.

## Implementation Summary

The state management architecture has been successfully refined to use domain-specific slices and memoized selector hooks. This implementation:

1. Maintains backward compatibility with existing components
2. Provides a more efficient way to access state data
3. Improves code organization and maintainability
4. Enhances type safety with better TypeScript integration
5. Makes components easier to test and refactor

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Domain-Specific State Slices

The global state is now organized into logical domain slices:

- `character`: Player and opponent character data
- `combat`: Combat state, turns, and logs
- `inventory`: Items owned by the player
- `journal`: Log of game events and discoveries
- `narrative`: Story points, choices, and narrative flow
- `ui`: UI-specific state like active tabs and modals

### 2. Selector Hook Factory

A selector hook factory has been implemented to create memoized hooks for accessing specific state data:

```typescript
// createSelectorHook.ts
export function createSelectorHook<T>(selector: StateSelector<T>) {
  return function useSelectorHook(): T {
    const { state } = useGame();
    
    const memoizedSelector = useCallback(
      (currentState: GameState) => selector(currentState),
      [selector]
    );
    
    return useMemo(() => memoizedSelector(state), [memoizedSelector, state]);
  };
}
```

### 3. Domain-Specific Selector Hooks

Selector hooks have been created for each domain slice:

- **Character**: `usePlayerCharacter`, `useOpponentCharacter`, `usePlayerHealth`, etc.
- **Combat**: `useCombatActive`, `useCombatType`, `useCombatRound`, etc.
- **Inventory**: `useInventoryItems`, `useItemsByCategory`, `useItemById`, etc.
- **Journal**: `useJournalEntries`, `useEntriesByType`, `useRecentEntries`, etc.
- **Narrative**: `useCurrentStoryPoint`, `useAvailableChoices`, `useNarrativeHistory`, etc.
- **UI**: `useIsLoading`, `useModalOpen`, `useNotifications`, etc.

### 4. Backward Compatibility Adapters

Adapters have been implemented to maintain backward compatibility with existing components:

```typescript
// Legacy components still work
function LegacyComponent() {
  const { state } = useGame();
  
  // Legacy state properties are still accessible
  const playerName = state.player?.name;
  const itemCount = state.inventory?.length;
  
  return <div>{playerName} has {itemCount} items</div>;
}
```

### 5. Test Utilities

Test utilities have been created to make testing with the new state architecture easier:

- `prepareStateForTesting`: Prepares a partial state for testing
- `adaptStateForTests`: Adapts a state for backward compatibility
- `mockStates`: Pre-configured state objects for common scenarios

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created to support the implementation:

1. **State Architecture v2**: Overview of the refined architecture
2. **Selector Migration Guide**: Instructions for updating components
3. **State Architecture Test Patterns**: Best practices for testing
4. **State Migration Summary**: This document

## Migration Strategy

The migration strategy allows for a gradual transition to the new architecture:

1. New components should use selector hooks directly
2. Existing components continue to work with legacy state access
3. Components can be migrated incrementally as needed
4. Critical components can be prioritized for migration
5. Tests have been updated to support both access patterns

## Performance Benefits

The new architecture provides several performance benefits:

1. **Reduced Re-renders**: Components only re-render when specific data changes
2. **Better Memoization**: Selector hooks use memoization for efficient data access
3. **Optimized Updates**: Domain-specific reducers can optimize state updates
4. **Improved Type Checking**: Better TypeScript integration reduces runtime errors
5. **More Efficient Testing**: Easier to test components in isolation

## Conclusion

The implementation of the refined state management architecture provides a solid foundation for future development. It balances the need for improved performance and maintainability with the practical requirement of backward compatibility.

The architecture is now ready for use, and the migration of existing components can proceed according to the provided migration guide.
