# AI Services Tests

This directory contains tests for the AI services module. The current tests provide basic coverage of the main functionality, but more comprehensive testing is needed.

## Current Test Coverage

- **aiDecisionService.test.ts**: Basic tests for the main service class
- **aiDecisionDetector.test.ts**: Tests for decision detection logic
- **aiServiceClient.test.ts**: Tests for the API client

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific tests
npm test -- aiDecisionService.test.ts
```

## Needed Test Coverage

See GitHub issue #[TBD] for the plan to expand test coverage.
