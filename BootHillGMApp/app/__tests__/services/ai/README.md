# Decision Context Refresh Test Refactoring

## Overview

The decision context refresh test has been refactored to improve organization, maintainability, and readability. The test now follows the project's existing patterns by placing utility functions in the `app/test/helpers` directory.

## File Structure

- **Main test file**: `/app/__tests__/services/ai/decision-context-refresh.test.ts`
  - Contains only the core test cases and assertions
  - Imports helper functions from the helpers directory

- **Helper functions**: `/app/test/helpers/decision-context.helpers.ts`
  - Contains all utility functions and mock implementations
  - Placed in the app/test/helpers directory to match project patterns
  - Improves organization and reusability

## Refactoring Approach

1. **Separate concerns**: Split test logic from helper functions
2. **Improve organization**: Placed helpers in the project's standard location
3. **Reduce file size**: Each file is now under 300 lines
4. **Enhance readability**: Made tests more declarative
5. **Leverage existing patterns**: Followed the project's conventions

## Benefits

- **Improved maintainability**: Test file is focused on testing, not setup
- **Better organization**: Clear separation of responsibilities
- **Reduced duplication**: Common patterns extracted to helper functions
- **Enhanced readability**: Tests are more declarative and easier to understand
- **Consistent patterns**: Follows the project's existing conventions

## Original Requirements Met

- ✅ Target Size: Both files are under 300 lines
- ✅ Maintainability: Files are well-organized and focused
- ✅ Exact Functionality: All tests maintain original behavior
- ✅ No New Patterns: Uses existing project patterns

This refactoring demonstrates how to organize test code effectively while maintaining compatibility with the project's existing structure and tools.
